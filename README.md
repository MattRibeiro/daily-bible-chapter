# Daily Bible Readings

This project was created for a small group of believers wanting to keep to the same Bible readings per day, to cover the entire bible, read from the Old Testament, Gospels + Acts, and the New Testament writings, but keep the readings to a managable size - both for daily consumption, and to review together weekly. The readings are a single chapter
per day (no matter how big or small that chapter might be), and follows the canonical order of each section - so you're not hopping around everywhere. We meet on Sunday, so there are no daily readings for that day. There 1189 chapters in the typical Protestant Bible, so that amounts to nearly 200 weeks of readings.

It creates links to the YouVersion bible app/web app. This project has no affiliation with YouVersion, but it offered a convenient, way for links to "just work" across lots of multiple platforms and potential Bible versions. Christendom is indebted to their great work. Please consider them as the Lord might lead you to give.

I first generated my reading list using a [simple script](./generateReadingList.js), and then copy-and-pasted that into the single, [static page](./index.html).

That's about it, I think.
